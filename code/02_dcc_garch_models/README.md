# DCC-GARCH Models

This section focuses on modeling dynamic correlations between the macro-financial index and asset returns using DCC-GARCH models.

## Overview

- **Rolling Correlation**: computes 90-day rolling correlations as a benchmark.
- **DCC-GARCH Models**: estimates various models to capture dynamic correlations.
- **VAR-DCC Comparison**: analyses models with and without conditional mean components.

## File Structure

- `dcc_main_driver.m`: main script for executing models.
- `dcc_compute_rolling.m`: script for computing rolling correlations.
