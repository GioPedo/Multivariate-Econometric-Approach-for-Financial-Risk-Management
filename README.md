# Dynamic Correlation for Risk Assessment in Finance
This repository contains an econometric study that has been applied to the financial risk management of an equally weighted (EW) portfolio.

Starting with a set of securities selected through Cluster Analysis (ML) and the construction of a macroeconomic-financial index, the study examines the evolution of the pairwise correlations between the purpose-built index and each security over a 5-year horizon and applies the final results to estimate the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES) of an EW portfolio.
In addition, the research is carried out on the same dataset, but excluding the most turbulent months of the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to analyse differences in both econometric and risk management results.
